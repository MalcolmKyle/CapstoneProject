# CapstoneProject

This capstone project was a project for my class in DCSP ( Distributed Client Server Programming). We focued on web development and database design. The primary languages used for this class were php, CSS, javascript, and python. 

For this particular project, a group of fellow students and I were charged with following the SDLC with a fictional business. We created a project that we wanted to created and followed steps in requirements, design, and implementation. Our project allowed users (with an account) to post items they have or need in order to trade with another user. 

One of the toughest part of this project was to verify a certain class of user was viewing the appropiate page. For instance, a user should not have access to an admin page. Nor should a non-logged in user be able to view certain pages. This allowed for a a chance for visitors to the site and understand what we are about with our about us page. However, we required a user to create an account to post to our site and interact with other users. 

My group and I developed with Bootstrap CSS website with Ajax, PHP, JavaScript, HTML,and SQL to allow registered users to trade items via our database. For this project, I created the login page, view all personal haves page, view all personal needs page, and the about us page.
